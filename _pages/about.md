About Me

I’m Itay Matya, a Mechanical Engineering student at Tel Aviv University with a passion for design, precision engineering, and hands-on problem-solving. 
I specialize in CAD modeling with SolidWorks, CNC design, and mechanical systems development — blending theory from my academic studies with real-world engineering projects.

My journey began with a strong technical foundation in the military as a combat sapper and tank operator, where I learned discipline, adaptability, and leadership under pressure. Since then, I’ve expanded my experience across mechanical fabrication, construction, and operations management, giving me a deep understanding of how engineering meets practical implementation.

Outside of academia, I am designing and building my own desktop CNC machine — capable of machining aluminum and steel — as part of an ongoing project to merge precision mechanics with modern digital fabrication. focusing on projects that combine creativity and functionality.

I hold a SolidWorks Associate Certification (CSWA) and maintain a GPA of 84, with a 99 in graphical engineering (CAD). My work reflects curiosity, dedication, and a drive to continually learn and improve.

You can explore my projects, engineering achievements, and portfolio on this site — showcasing how I approach mechanical design, prototyping, and problem-solving with both technical rigor and creativity.
